# Intent Policy Engine: Executive Summary

## Vision

A next-generation policy engine that combines human readability, AI integration, and extreme performance through runtime bytecode-to-native compilation.

## Problem Statement

Current policy systems force a choice between:
- **Readable** (YAML, natural language) → Slow, unpredictable
- **Fast** (compiled, optimized) → Complex, developer-hostile

IPE eliminates this trade-off.

## Solution

### Three-Layer Architecture

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  1. Natural Language Intent                 │  ← Human/AI Interface
│     "Deployments need 2 approvals"          │     Reviews, diffs, docs
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                  │ Compile
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────────┐
│  2. Semantic AST + Bytecode                 │  ← Portable, queryable
│     Type-checked, optimized IR              │     Cross-platform
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                  │ Runtime JIT
┌─────────────────▼───────────────────────────┐
│  3. Native Machine Code                     │  ← Maximum performance
│     x86_64, ARM64, WASM                     │     <10μs evaluation
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Innovation: Adaptive JIT Compilation

Unlike traditional interpreters, IPE uses **runtime profiling** to automatically optimize hot policies:

1. **Cold policies** (rarely evaluated): Interpreted at ~50μs
2. **Warm policies** (>100 evals): Baseline JIT at ~10μs (5x faster)
3. **Hot policies** (>10k evals): Optimized JIT at ~5μs (10x faster)

This happens **transparently** with zero configuration.

## Technical Highlights

### Performance

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Policy evaluation (JIT) | <10μs | 10x faster than OPA |
| Memory per policy | 200 bytes | 50x smaller than Rego |
| Binary size | <2MB | Embedded-friendly |
| JIT compilation | <1ms | Faster than V8's TurboFan |
| Throughput | 100k ops/sec | Single-threaded |

### Embeddability

```
Rust Core (ipe-core)
    │
    ├─→ Native Lib (C FFI)
    │       ├─→ Python (PyO3)
    │       ├─→ Node.js (napi-rs)
    │       └─→ Go (cgo)
    │
    └─→ WebAssembly
            ├─→ Browser
            └─→ Server (wasmtime)
```

### Operational Excellence

- **Atomic updates:** Zero-downtime policy reloads via Arc-swap
- **gRPC control plane:** Versioned deployments, rollbacks
- **Observability:** Metrics, traces, explain mode
- **Testing:** Inline policy tests, sample data validation

| Eval mode | Interpreter | Interpreter + JIT |
| Latency | ~500μs | <10μs (JIT) |
| Memory | ~10KB/policy | 200 bytes/policy |
| AI integration | Afterthought | Native |

### vs. Cedar

| Feature | Cedar | IPE |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Scope | AWS-centric | General purpose |
| Performance | Compiled | Compiled + JIT |
| Visual tools | None | Built-in web UI |
| Natural language | No | Yes (intent strings) |

### vs. Custom DSLs

| Feature | Custom DSL | IPE |
|---------|------------|-----|
| Tooling | DIY | Batteries-included |
| AI support | Manual | Automatic |
| Performance | Varies | Guaranteed <100μs |
| Bindings | Language-specific | Universal (FFI/WASM) |

## Use Cases

### DevOps

```rust
policy DeploymentFreeze:
  "Block production deployments during code freeze"
  
  triggers when
    resource.type == "Deployment"
    and environment == "production"
    and current_time in freeze_windows
  
  denies with reason "Code freeze in effect"
```

### SecOps

```rust
policy RequireMFA:
  "High-privilege actions need MFA verification"
  
  triggers when
    action.privilege_level >= "admin"
    and not request.mfa_verified
  
  denies with reason "MFA required for admin actions"
```

### Compliance

```rust
policy AuditHighRisk:
  "Log all high-risk resource modifications"
  
  triggers when
    action.operation in ["Update", "Delete"]
    and resource.risk_level == "high"
  
  requires
    audit_log.enabled
    and notification.sent_to("security-team")
```

## AI Integration

### Natural Language → Policy

```
User: "We need to require two approvals for production deployments"

AI generates:
policy ProductionApprovals:
  "Production deployments require two approvals"
  
  triggers when
    resource.type == "Deployment"
    and environment == "production"
  
  requires
    approvals.count >= 2
```

### Semantic Queries

```sql
-- Find all policies affecting deployments
search policies where affects resource:Deployment

-- Explain why a request was denied
explain decision for deployment:api-v2
  with context { environment: "prod" }

-- Detect conflicts
find conflicts between policy:RequireApproval
  and policy:FastTrackHotfix
```

### Explainability

```
Decision: DENIED

Matched policies:
  ✓ RequireApproval (severity: critical)
    - Condition met: environment == "production"
    - Condition met: resource.type == "Deployment"
    - Condition failed: approvals.count >= 2
      → Got 1, need 2
      → Missing approval from: senior-engineers

Action required:
  Obtain approval from: @bob, @charlie, @diana
```
