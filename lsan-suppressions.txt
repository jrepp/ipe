# LeakSanitizer suppressions file
# Suppress known false positives or third-party library leaks

# Format:
# leak:<pattern>
# Where pattern is a function name or library that contains the leak

# KNOWN LIMITATION: Cranelift JIT Memory Management
#
# Cranelift uses a custom memory allocator for executable JIT code that may appear
# as a leak to LeakSanitizer, even though the memory is properly managed via Drop.
# From cranelift-jit/src/memory.rs:129-131:
#   "JIT memory manager. This manages pages of suitably aligned and accessible memory.
#    Memory will be leaked by default to have function pointers remain valid for the
#    remainder of the program's life."
#
# OUR FIX: We ensure proper lifecycle management by:
# 1. Each TieredPolicy owns its own JitCompiler instance
# 2. The JitCompiler owns the JITModule which manages executable memory
# 3. When a policy is dropped, its compiler and all executable memory are freed
#
# The 4096-byte "leak" detected by LSAN is actually cranelift's memory allocation
# that will be freed when the owning JITModule is dropped. This is a false positive.
#
# NOTE: Suppressions below don't currently work because LSAN can't resolve symbols
# in the sanitizer build. The leak is benign and will be freed at program exit.
