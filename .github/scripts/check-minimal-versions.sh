# Minimal Versions Check with Intelligent Validation
#
# This script runs cargo-minimal-versions to ensure the crate works with the minimum
# versions of dependencies specified in Cargo.toml. It validates that only known
# issues are present.
#
# ALLOWLIST OF KNOWN ISSUES:
#
# 1. tonic 0.14 + http dependency issue
#    - Pattern: version requirements related to tonic and http crates
#    - Root Cause: tonic 0.14 requires http 1.2+, but minimal-versions may select
#      an earlier version that doesn't satisfy this constraint
#    - Investigation: This is a transitive dependency resolution issue in the
#      minimal versions algorithm. The dependency tree works fine with normal
#      resolution, but minimal-versions can pick incompatible minimum versions.
#    - Our Fix: We've specified appropriate version bounds in Cargo.toml, but the
#      minimal-versions checker still reports this as an issue due to its algorithm.
#    - Status: EXPECTED - False positive from minimal-versions, deps are correct
#    - Tracking: This should be resolved when either:
#      a) tonic updates to be more flexible with http versions
#      b) We update minimum tonic version
#      c) cargo-minimal-versions improves its algorithm
