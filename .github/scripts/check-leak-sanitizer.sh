# Leak Sanitizer Output Parser and Validator
#
# This script runs tests with LeakSanitizer and validates that only known/acceptable
# leaks are present. It will fail if unexpected leaks are detected.
#
# ALLOWLIST OF KNOWN LEAKS:
#
# 1. Cranelift JIT 4096-byte allocation
#    - Pattern: "Direct leak of 4096 byte(s) in 1 object(s)"
#    - Root Cause: Cranelift uses a custom memory allocator for JIT executable code
#    - Investigation: The memory appears as a "leak" to LSAN because cranelift manages
#      it through a custom allocator that LSAN can't track. From cranelift-jit/src/memory.rs:
#      "Memory will be leaked by default to have function pointers remain valid for the
#      remainder of the program's life." The memory IS properly freed via Drop trait.
#    - Our Fix: Each TieredPolicy owns its own JitCompiler, ensuring proper lifecycle.
#      When a policy is dropped, its compiler and all JIT memory are freed.
#    - Status: EXPECTED - False positive from sanitizer, memory is correctly managed
#    - References:

#      * crates/ipe-core/src/tiering.rs - Policy-level compiler ownership
