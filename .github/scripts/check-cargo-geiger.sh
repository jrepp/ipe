# Cargo Geiger Unsafe Code Scanner with Intelligent Validation
#
# This script runs cargo-geiger and validates that core crates remain free of unsafe code
# while allowing unsafe in dependencies where necessary.
#
# ALLOWLIST POLICY:
#
# 1. Core IPE crates (ipe-core, ipe-control, ipe-cli) MUST have zero unsafe blocks
# 2. Dependencies MAY use unsafe if necessary (e.g., cranelift, tokio internals)
# 3. Any new unsafe code in core crates must be explicitly documented here
#
# KNOWN ACCEPTABLE UNSAFE USAGE:
#
# Currently: NONE in core crates
#
# Dependencies with unsafe (expected):
# - cranelift-* (JIT compilation requires unsafe for executable memory)
# - tokio internals (async runtime primitives)
# - parking_lot (lock-free data structures)
