## 🚀 Next Steps: Start Development

You're now ready to begin **Phase 1: Parser & AST** (Weeks 1-2). Here's how to get started:

### Step 1: Set Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone and enter repository
cd /Users/jrepp/dev/ipe

# Install Rust toolchain (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Install all development tools
make install-tools

# Verify setup
make check
```

### Step 2: Run Initial Build & Tests

```bash
# Build all crates
make build

# Run tests (will fail initially - that's expected!)
make test

# Run benchmarks (placeholder implementations)
make bench

# Generate coverage report
make coverage
```

### Step 3: Begin Phase 1 Development

Follow the **[MVP_PLAN.md](MVP_PLAN.md)** Week 1 deliverables:

#### Week 1: Lexer & Basic Parser

**Tasks:**
1. Implement lexer using `logos` crate
   - File: `crates/ipe-core/src/parser/lexer.rs`
   - Define tokens (keywords, operators, literals)
   - Position tracking for error messages

2. Implement basic parser using `nom`
   - File: `crates/ipe-core/src/parser/parser.rs`
   - Policy structure parsing
   - Expression parsing

3. Write comprehensive tests
   - File: `crates/ipe-core/tests/parser_tests.rs`
   - Test all RFC examples
   - Error recovery tests

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Parse all RFC examples correctly
- [ ] <10ms parsing for 1000-line file
- [ ] Helpful error messages
- [ ] >90% test coverage

### Step 4: Set Up Development Workflow

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b phase1/parser-week1

# Development cycle (run after each change)
make dev

# Before committing
make pre-commit

# Run full CI locally
make ci
```

### Step 5: Monitor Quality

```bash
# Check code coverage (aim for >90%)
make coverage

# Run security audit
make audit

# Run benchmarks
make bench

# Run load tests (when implementation exists)
cargo run --release --example load_test -- --evals 100000
```
